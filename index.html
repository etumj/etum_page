        <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
            <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
            command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
            everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
            Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
            We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
            learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
            movement, <a href="https://learnenough.com/email"> sign up for our official email list </a> now.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the 
            <a href ="https://railstutorial.org"> Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the
            <a href ="https://www.softcover.io">Sotfcover publishing platform</a>
            This page is part of the sample site for
            <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough HTML to
            be Dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of <strong>H</strong>

        <h2>Founders</h2>

        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
            Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
            sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
            <strong>at least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.

        <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>
        <p>
            Micheal is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">
            Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
            <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to be Dangerous</a>
            introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
            <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step 
            plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillian 
            are slightly exaggerated.

        <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>
        <p>
            When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder 
            stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer
            designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some 
            of the interface-related Learn Enough Tutorials.

        <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>
        <p>
            You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on 
            Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a 
            true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of
            code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
